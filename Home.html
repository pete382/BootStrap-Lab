                The absence of morality costs American taxpayers treasures. Inflation grows while corporations make record profits- even those not in the defense industry. The gouge is in!  The end results are higher interest rates affecting small and medium sized banks who hold commercial real estate deeds as collateral. A domino effect begins as small business loans become a harder hill to climb. Then unemployment.
                Just policies lead to long term growth and prosperity. The push from inflation causes employers to hire less and automate more. Business has a miserly, unforgiving, nature.  
                Corporate power rules over in Japan and South Korea. These are paradigms of populations in decline where overworked societies increasingly rely on automation to care for the aged than relying on the younger generations.
                A Darwinian survival of the fittest is taking place based on money, likely based on a great idea, and equal parts corrupt legislation or no legislation. And our fiscal checks and balances, especially for war, circumvents or politicizes on cult patriotic allegiances.
